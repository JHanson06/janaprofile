# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I am a freshman at Florida A&M University (FAMU), currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I'm eager to learn and grow in the field and am actively seeking opportunities to land my first internship, starting in summer 2025. I’m enthusiastic about expanding my skills and open to any opportunities that will help me progress career-wise, networking-wise, and skill-wise.

I am currently learning through Microsoft Student Certifications and university courses, focusing on foundational coding skills like Java and Python.

Fun fact: I earned my PowerPoint and Word certifications in high school and graduated with them!
